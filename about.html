            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Bassim, a passionate and curious MCA student with a love for technology.
            I specialize in building web and mobile apps that solve real-world problems.
            Right now, I'm focused on improving my skills in JavaScript, React, and backend tools.
            I enjoy experimenting with code and creating smooth, user-friendly interfaces.
            I'm also deeply into mobile photography and videography as a creative outlet.
            Using my Nothing Phone 2 and the Blackmagic Camera app, I capture high-quality visuals.
            As a big fan of the Nothing brand, I admire its innovation and design.
            I believe in continuous learning and enjoy staying updated with tech trends.
            I love collaborating with others on tech projects to learn and grow together.
            My long-term goal is to create meaningful software that impacts lives positively.
            </p>
